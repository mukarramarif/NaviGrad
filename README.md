## Overview

The NaviGrad project leverages advanced AI models and modern web technologies to provide a seamless user experience. 

### Claude Sonnet 3.5 Model

The Claude Sonnet 3.5 model is a state-of-the-art AI language model designed to understand and generate human-like text. It is particularly useful for natural language processing tasks such as text generation, summarization, and conversational agents. In this project, the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model is utilized to provide intelligent responses and advice to college students based on their queries.

### Backend with Express.js

Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications. It is used in this project to handle server-side logic, manage routes, and interact with the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model. The backend is responsible for processing user requests, querying the AI model, and sending back the appropriate responses.

### Frontend with jQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, and animation much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. In this project, jQuery is used on the frontend to create a dynamic and interactive user interface. It handles user inputs, sends AJAX requests to the Express.js backend, and updates the UI based on the responses received.

By combining the Claude Sonnet 3.5 model with Express.js and jQuery, NaviGrad provides a powerful and user-friendly platform for college students seeking advice and information.
